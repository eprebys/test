00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:08.600
OK, so now I am recording
a Zoome session with myself

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.720
using the Loom application and recording

3
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.920
this so that I can test the
effectiveness of captions.

4
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.600
I want to know how well
it will caption some

5
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.880
mathematics.

6
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.920
So if we were calculating the.

7
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.360
Integral of X from one to two, the X.

8
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.640
That equals,

9
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.280
see, is this reversed, so for me,

10
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.040
this side this side over here is my
this is my right hand right now

11
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.560
and it shows up on my screen on
the right side of my screen.

12
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.520
So if I'm looking at myself in the zoom
session, it looks like I'd make my axes.

13
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.880
Here's my x axis.

14
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.160
Here's my Y axis.

15
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.960
Here would be the line Y equals X.

16
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.640
I suspect, though, that this
is going to be reversed.

17
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.840
So I'm going to try to reverse it just to

18
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.240
see if I can get myself to
stumble for the captioning.

19
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.520
So here we have our Y-axis, our X axis,

20
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.360
and here is Y equals X and
we're going from one to two.

21
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.040
So from zero to two would be half
of a two by two square four.

22
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.800
But we need to take off that portion from

23
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.240
zero to one, which is half
of a one by one square.

24
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.320
So one half.
So

25
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.720
two minus one half is one and a half.
